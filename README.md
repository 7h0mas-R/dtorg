# darktable-web

This is a repository for testing migrating [darktable.org][] to [Pelican][].

[darktable.org]: http://darktable.org
[Pelican]: https://blog.getpelican.com/


## Front Page

Content for the front page by priority at the moment:
    * Project name + description
    * Screenshots
    * 3-4 features to highlight


## News/Blog

These are two distinct things, possibly merge them but get a consensus from the dt team what they want.
