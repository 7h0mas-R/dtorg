There is an online repository with darktable styles available for download at <http://dtstyle.net/>. It features live preview of the styles with four different sample images.

To create a new darktable style just alter your image the way you want. Then click the button located in the history module in darkroom mode to create a style from the current history stack. In advanced options you can include or exclude single modules. To export or import a new style use the styles module in lighttable mode.
