Here is a short list of highlights where darktable can improve your digital photography processing workflow and help you to make better images with less effort. You can find a more detailed description of every single item in our [online user manual](https://www.darktable.org/resources/).

# General Features

*   **Non-destructive** editing throughout the complete workflow, your original images are never modified.
*   **Take advantage of the real power of raw**: All darktable core functions operate on **4x32-bit floating point pixel buffers**, enabling SSE instructions for speedups.
*   **GPU accelerated image processing**: many image opertions are lightning fast thanks to  **OpenCL** support (runtime detection and enabling).
*   **Professional color management**: darktable is fully color managed, supporting automatic display profile detection on most systems, including built-in ICC profile support for sRGB, Adobe RGB, XYZ and linear RGB color spaces.
*   **Cross platform**: darktable runs on Linux, Mac OS X / macports, BSD, Windows and Solaris 11 / GNOME.
*   **Filtering and sorting**: search your image collections by tags, image rating (stars), color labels and many more, use flexible database queries on all metadata of your images.
*   **Image formats**: darktable can import a variety of standard, raw and high dynamic range image formats (e.g. JPEG, CR2, NEF, HDR, PFM, RAF ... ).
*   **Zero-latency, zoomable user interface**: through multi-level software caches darktable provides a fluid experience.
*   **Tethered shooting**: support for instrumentation of your camera with live view for some camera brands.
*   **Speaks your language**: darktable is also translated into more than a dozen different languages. As the list of supported translations changes with each release, you are advised to check the [news page](https://www.darktable.org/news/) for more details.
*   **Powerful export system** supports Piwigo webalbums, disk storage, 1:1 copy, email attachments and can generate a simple html-based web gallery. darktable allows you to export to low dynamic range (JPEG, PNG, TIFF), 16-bit (PPM, TIFF), or linear high dynamic range (PFM, EXR) images.
*   **Never lose your image development settings** darktable uses both **XMP sidecar** files as well as its **fast database** for saving metadata and processing settings. All Exif data is read and written using libexiv2.
*   **Automate repetitive tasks**: Many aspects of darktable can be scripted in Lua.
