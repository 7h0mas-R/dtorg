This is a meta page about this website and building it.
I, ([Pat David](https://patdavid.net)), created this page for notes about building the site.



## Pelican

We're using [Python][] + [Pelican][] to create a static website.

[Python]: https://www.python.org/ "Python Homepage"
[Pelican]: https://blog.getpelican.com/ "Pelican Blog"



## Content Classification

From a template/Pelican point of view, there are 2 major types of generated content: `pages` and `articles`.

* `pages` are static pages like [about](/about) or [install](/install).
* `articles` are timely, chronological content like [news](/news) or [blog](/blog) posts.
